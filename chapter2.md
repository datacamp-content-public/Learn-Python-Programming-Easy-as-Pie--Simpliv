  title: "Learn Python Programming — Easy as Pie"
  description: "The code-alongs in this class all use Python 2.7. Source code (with copious amounts of comments) is attached as a resource with all the code-alongs. The source code has been provided for both Python 2 and Python 3 wherever possible.\n\nWhat’s Covered:\n\nIntroductory Python: Functional language constructs; Python syntax; Lists, dictionaries, functions and function objects; Lambda functions; iterators, exceptions and file-handling\nDatabase operations: Just as much database knowledge as you need to do data manipulation in Python\nAuto-generating spreadsheets: Kill the drudgery of reporting tasks with xlsxwriter; automated reports that combine database operations with spreadsheet auto-generation\nText processing and NLP: Python’s powerful tools for text processing — nltk and others.\nWebsite scraping using Beautiful Soup: Scrapers for the New York Times and Washington Post\nMachine Learning : Use sk-learn to apply machine learning techniques like KMeans clustering\nHundreds of lines of code with hundreds of lines of comments\nDrill #1: Download a zip file from the National Stock Exchange of India; unzip and process to find the 3 most actively traded securities for the day\nDrill #2: Store stock-exchange time-series data for 3 years in a database. On-demand, generate a report with a time-series for a given stock ticker\nDrill #3: Scrape a news article URL and auto-summarize into 3 sentences\nDrill #4: Scrape newspapers and a blog and apply several machine learning techniques — classification and clustering to these\nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN\n\nPick up programming even if you have NO programming experience at all\nWrite Python programs of moderate complexity\nPerform complicated text processing — splitting articles into sentences and words and doing things with them\nWork with files, including creating Excel spreadsheets and working with zip files\nApply simple machine learning and natural language processing concepts such as classification, clustering and summarization\nUnderstand Object-Oriented Programming in a Python context"
